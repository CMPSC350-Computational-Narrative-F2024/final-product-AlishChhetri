D&D Story Generator

## Description

This project converts D&D session transcripts into a cohesive storybook with GPT-4-generated text and DALL-E 3 illustrations. Key features include tab-indented paragraphs, periodic images every five paragraphs, and a linear narrative.

Challenges: Managing long inputs, ensuring paragraph coherence, and achieving consistent image quality have been demanding.

Enjoyable: Watching fragmented notes transform into rich chapters with visuals has been rewarding.

Shifts: Initially text-only, the project now includes inter-paragraph imagery and enhanced formatting for readability.
