# CMPSC 350: Project Plan

## Summary

This project transforms a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaign transcript into a cohesive linear narrative using an AI-powered multi-model approach. A language model (LLM) will process the transcript to create a structured story, while an image generator will produce illustrations for key scenes and characters. The final product will be a visually immersive storybook, combining narrative and imagery to capture the essence of the campaign. This project explores the creative potential and limitations of AI in storytelling and visual art.

## Peer works

1. Building a Narrative in D&D

    This article highlights how D&D campaigns reflect high fantasy storytelling, blending player choices with collaborative narratives. It shows how campaigns naturally align with linear storytelling, motivating the adaptation of a transcript into a structured narrative.

2. Vox Machina (Critical Role)

    Vox Machina is a D&D campaign successfully adapted into a cohesive, linear narrative as an animated series. This inspires the project’s goal of transforming a campaign transcript into an engaging story while preserving its essence.

3. Children’s Book Generation Project (GitHub)

    This project demonstrates combining AI-generated text and visuals into a cohesive product. Its modular approach to text, images, and formatting informs this project's workflow for creating a narrative with illustrations.

## Challenges

One major challenge is ensuring the output is formatted cohesively, with the AI-generated text and images seamlessly integrated into a professional, polished document. Managing consistent styles between text and illustrations, especially given the variability of AI outputs, could be complex. Another potential issue is maintaining narrative coherence when transforming non-linear, player-driven events from the D&D transcript into a linear story. Finally, balancing manual intervention and automation for both text and visuals will require careful planning to ensure the final product meets creative and technical expectations.
